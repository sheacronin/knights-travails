# Knights Travails

[Knights Travails project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-knights-travails) from The Odin Project's Ruby Course, exercising understanding of graph data structures and Breadth-First Search.

A knight on a chess board moves in a 1x2 or 2x1 path. With enough turns, it can move from any square on the board to any other square. The `Knight`'s `#move` method returns the shortest possible path from a starting position to its goal.
